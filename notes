TODOS:

TODO: fail better when the rddl file doesn't exist at the given location. use experiemttal::filesystem probably?
TODO: should really clean up makefiles for everything. thinking about debugging versus whatever else.

TODO: test coverage for RDDL stuff in libmdp? along with general cleaning up and improvements?
TODO: what's the best way to clean up PROST inclusion as a lib? Would prefer to only have the interface classes and trivial additions to the makefile relative to the upstream. Possible?
TODO: switch from prost-dd-1 code to prost core code for lib

TODO: separate debugging and release options (needed because of changes made for building prost and libmdp with debugging)
TODO: need to make discount factor available from the RDDL instance file (parsed through prost) for libmdp

TODO: hard coded change in RDDL that allows integers to be state fluents has 300 upper limit on int values. this is a dumb thing to do. fix. rddl.cc in rddl_parser. (hard coded to 300)

TODO: need to add PROST-side caching back in. don't know what the bug was that was a problem when enabled. probably useful to speed stuff up on queries, etc. Would be good to use it.

Fix make invocation so that we can actually build in parallel.
